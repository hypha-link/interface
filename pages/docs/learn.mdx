# Learn About Hypha

## Core principles

Hypha has a few core principles that are followed at all times. 
This will serve as a general list of them that users can expect when using our platform.

* Decentralization
* User Ownership of Data
* Full Transparency
* Privacy

## Original Concept

Hypha began as a submission to a hackathon. 
After the conclusion of the hackathon, the project continued to be developed because there was and still is a genuine need for a decentralized messaging application.
Since those early days, the project has been grealty expanded and has now become one of the most private & user focused communication platforms on the internet.
An early and continued inspiration is the Signal Foundation and their messenger, 'Signal'.
Their group has created a beautiful and safe, yet responsive interface for the general public.
Another inspiration is Discord for its ability to gather such a wide range of people & interests in one space, while also providing many features to its users.
Ultimately our goal is for Hypha to become the best of all worlds in the messaging space, affording users not only privacy, but also a feature rich experience.
